The formalized proof is constructive, and relies on nothing but the axioms and rules of the foundational framework implemented by Coq. To support the formalization, we developed a comprehensive set of reusable libraries of formalized mathematics, including results in finite group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, and the theories of the real and complex algebraic numbers.",

The proof of the Kepler conjecture was first obtained by Ferguson and Hales in 1998.  The proof relies on about 300 pages of text and on a large number of computer calculations.},

Both the ternary Goldbach conjecture and the binary, or strong, Goldbach conjecture had their origin in an exchange of letters between Euler and Goldbach in 1742. We will follow an approach based on the circle method, the large sieve and exponential sums, supplemented by rigorous computations, including a verification of zeros of L-functions due to D. Platt. The improved estimates on exponential sums are proven in a twin paper by the author.
