The Kepler conjecture asserts that no packing of congruent balls in Euclidean 3-space has density greater than the face-centered cubic packing.  It is the oldest problem in discrete geometry.  The proof of the Kepler conjecture was first obtained by Ferguson and Hales in 1998.  The proof relies on about 300 pages of text and on a large number of computer calculations.},

Both the ternary Goldbach conjecture and the binary, or strong, Goldbach conjecture had their origin in an exchange of letters between Euler and Goldbach in 1742. We will follow an approach based on the circle method, the large sieve and exponential sums, supplemented by rigorous computations, including a verification of zeros of L-functions due to D. Platt. The improved estimates on exponential sums are proven in a twin paper by the author.
