  annote = {It remains to discuss the question of error. One can take precautions against machine errors either by running all the calculations twice or by checks included in the program. Moreover machines --- unlike human beings --- are so designed that the errors they make are usually too gross to be overlooked. We are satisfied that there are in our results no undetected errors of this sort. On the other hand, in translating an elaborate scheme of calculation into a machine program one is bound to make mistakes. Most of these are found before the program is used for production runs; they show up because the program grinds to a halt or produces ridiculous results. But a program which is believed to work may still contain logical errors which only have an effect in rare circumstances: and indeed most computers have anomalies which cause them occasionally not to behave in the way that their specifications suggest. In fact, our program for stage (ii) was imperfect in that a very few equivalences were missed by the machine.
For these reasons we believe that results obtained from a computer should not be automatically trusted. In some cases they can be checked because they have properties which were not essentially used in the course of the calculation and which would be unlikely to survive if an error had been made. But if checks of this sort are not available, results should not be fully trusted until they have been independently reproduced by a different programmer using a different machine.

To support the formalization, we developed a comprehensive set of reusable libraries of formalized mathematics, including results in finite group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, and the theories of the real and complex algebraic numbers.",

Both the ternary Goldbach conjecture and the binary, or strong, Goldbach conjecture had their origin in an exchange of letters between Euler and Goldbach in 1742. We will follow an approach based on the circle method, the large sieve and exponential sums, supplemented by rigorous computations, including a verification of zeros of L-functions due to D. Platt. The improved estimates on exponential sums are proven in a twin paper by the author.
